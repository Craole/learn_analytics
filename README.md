# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to this Data Analytics Portfolio, showcasing several projects that demonstrate proficiency in using various data analytics tools and techniques with different technology stacks to gain insights and inform business decisions.

## Project 1: NBA Stats Analysis

This project analyzes NBA statistics to gain insights into player performance and team strategies. The data is queried from a PostgreSQL database using SQL, and the Python programming language is used for data cleaning and manipulation. The project uses the following tools and libraries:

### Data Management

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) | SQL database used for data storage and retrieval. |

### Data Manipulation

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) | High-level programming language used for data cleaning and manipulation. It has extensive libraries for data analysis and numerical computations. |
| [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) | Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. |
| [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) | Python library used for numerical computations and data analysis. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. |
| [POSIX Shell](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) | Shell scripting language used to automate tasks such as initializing the database and other automation tasks. |

### Data Visualization

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/) | Business intelligence and data visualization tool used to create interactive reports and dashboards. It provides a wide range of visualization options and data modeling tools. |

The following images are sample visualizations from the Power BI dashboard created for this project:

- *![NBA Stats Dashboard](nba_stats_dashboard.png)*: A scatter plot showing the relationship between player efficiency rating (PER) and points per game (PPG). This visualization revealed that players with higher PER tend to score more points per game.

- *![NBA Stats Dashboard](nba_stats_dashboard.png)*: A bar chart comparing the offensive and defensive efficiency ratings of different NBA teams. This visualization revealed that some teams excel at both offense and defense, while others struggle with one or the other.

- *![NBA Stats Dashboard](nba_stats_dashboard.png)*: A line chart showing the trend in three-point shooting percentage over time. This visualization revealed that three-point shooting percentage has increased over the past few decades.
